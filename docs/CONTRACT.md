# athens-transit contract v1

Shared interface between the backend (`athens-transit-rt`, Go, on a home machine)
and the frontend (`athens-transit-map`, Svelte, on GitHub Pages).
Source of truth: `athens-transit-rt/docs/CONTRACT.md`. The frontend keeps a copy.

## Ownership rules

- The backend owns this contract. v1 changes are **additive only** (new optional
  fields, new endpoints). A breaking change needs a `/v2` path.
- The frontend never edits the backend repo. It asks for a change with a GitHub
  issue on `angelospk/athens-transit-rt`, label `contract`.
- Each change to this file bumps the `Revision` line below and is copied to the
  frontend repo by whoever made it (backend thread opens the copy as a commit or
  issue on the frontend repo).

Revision: 12 (2026-10-29): `direction` on `/v2` Vehicles; STASY Pattern directions follow
branches (M3 airport)
(rev 8: `GET /v1/stops/{stop_id}` (a stop board); the unified `/v2` API
([below](#unified-api-v2-rev-8)); rev 7: `path_speeds` also follow today's traffic (same shape and units); rev 6: `path_speeds` on vehicles (typical speeds ahead); rev 5: `GET /v1/vehicles/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}`; rev 4: `path_beyond` and `path_stops` on vehicles; rev 3: `GET /v1/vehicles`; `speed` and
`path` on vehicles)

## Hosts

| Host | Served by | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `https://transit.haroldpoi.dev` | Home machine → Cloudflare Tunnel → Cloudflare cache | Live data (small, changes every ~30 s) |
| `https://angelospk.github.io/athens-transit-rt/static/v1/` | GitHub Pages of the backend repo | Static map data (changes only when OASA publishes a new GTFS) |
| `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelospk/athens-transit-rt/stats/v1/` | `stats` branch of the backend repo, copied daily from `/v1/stats` | Daily network statistics ([API.md](API.md#daily-statistics)) |
| `https://bus.haroldpoi.dev` | GitHub Pages of the frontend repo | The map app |

All JSON is UTF-8. Line ids are the OASA telematics `LineID` in Greek uppercase
(`040`, `550`, `Α1`, `Χ96`), percent-encoded in URLs. The backend also accepts the
Latin look-alikes (`A1` → `Α1`). Times are Unix seconds (integers).
CORS: every live and static response has `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

## Live API (`transit.haroldpoi.dev`)

### `GET /v1/lines/{line_id}`

Vehicles of one line. One URL per line so all users share one cached copy.
The frontend combines lines in the browser. Max 5 lines per client (enforced in UI).

```json
{
  "line": "040",
  "updated_at": 1791100000,
  "next_update_at": 1791100030,
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "id": "52134",
      "lat": 37.9755, "lon": 23.7348,
      "bearing": 180,
      "position_at": 1791099988,
      "route_code": "2045",
      "variant": "2045",
      "trip_id": "12345-WINTER",
      "trip_label": "00:35 ΠΕΙΡΑΙΑΣ → ΣΥΝΤΑΓΜΑ",
      "delay_s": 140,
      "next_stop_id": "400012",
      "speed": 6.4,
      "path": [[37.9755, 23.7348], [37.97601, 23.73502], [37.9781, 23.7356]],
      "path_beyond": [[37.9781, 23.7356], [37.98145, 23.73668], [37.98466, 23.73771]],
      "path_stops": [298, 682, 1050],
      "path_speeds": [6.2, 3.1, 4.8, 5.5, null, 7.0, 6.1, 5.9]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `trip_id`, `trip_label`, `delay_s`, `next_stop_id` are `null` when the vehicle is
  not matched to a scheduled trip. `bearing` may be `null`.
- `variant` keys into `static/v1/lines/{line_id}.json` → `variants` (for shape + stops).
  It may be `null` if no static variant matches.
- `speed` (rev 3): smoothed speed along the route in m/s, one decimal, 0..20. It is the
  median slope over the vehicle's recent fixes (up to 5, within 300 s) as distance along
  its shape; moving less than 20 m over them gives `0` (standing). `null` when unknown:
  fewer than 2 fixes ≥ 20 s apart on the same shape (first sighting, new run, long gap
  between polls), position on the shape ambiguous (a loop or out-and-back passes there
  twice and history cannot tell which), more than 150 m from the shape, no shape.
- `path` (rev 3): the route ahead as `[lat, lon]` pairs (5 decimals), from the vehicle's
  projected point on its shape (at `position_at`) to its next stop when matched,
  otherwise `max(speed × 150 s, 300 m)` ahead; at most 1.5 km and never past the
  shape's end. Simplified (5 m), so a straight street has 2 points. `null` when there is
  nothing to move along: no shape, > 150 m from it, ambiguous position, or already at the
  next stop / the shape's end. Use: move the marker along `path` at `speed` from
  `position_at`, stop at the last point and wait for the next update. The static
  `shape` is not needed for this.
- `path_beyond` (rev 4): matched vehicles only, the route on from the end of `path` (from
  the vehicle's point when `path` is `null` because it is at its next stop) to its third
  stop ahead; at most 1.5 km from the vehicle and never past the shape's end. Same format
  as `path`; its first point is the last point of `path`. `null` when unmatched, ambiguous,
  waiting to start, past the last stop, or when `path` already reaches the 1.5 km limit.
- `path_stops` (rev 4): the stops on `path` followed by `path_beyond`, as whole metres along
  those points (joined, the shared point once), ascending; the next stop is the end of
  `path`. `null` when not matched or no stop is on them. Use (rev 4 clients): drive
  `path` then `path_beyond` from `position_at`, slowing down and waiting a little at each
  of `path_stops`.
- `path_speeds` (rev 6): matched vehicles only, the typical speed ahead in m/s (one decimal,
  at least 0.1) for consecutive 200 m steps from the vehicle's point along its shape: step `i`
  covers metres `200·i` to `200·(i+1)` ahead, the last one may be shorter (shape's end), at
  most 8 steps (1.6 km). It comes from the last 14 days of fixes of vehicles on the same shape,
  per 200 m of the shape, day type (weekday, Saturday, Sunday) and local hour, falling back to
  all hours; waits at stops and lights are included. Rev 7: where buses of any line crossed
  the same road in the same direction in the last 20 minutes (at least 2 buses, per 100 m of
  road), that road counts at 0.7 × their speed + 0.3 × the typical one (their speed alone
  without history). A step with neither is `null`. `null` when unmatched, waiting to start,
  or nothing ahead is known. Clients need no change. Use (rev 6 clients): move along `path` then `path_beyond` from `position_at` at
  the step speeds (a `null` step at `speed`, or 1.5 m/s without one), instead of the stop
  waits; stop at the end of the points, as before. Metres are along the shape; the 5 m
  simplified points are a few metres shorter, so a client may simply walk them.
- Headers: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=<seconds until next_update_at, min 5, max 300>`.
  The frontend refetches a line at `next_update_at + 1..3 s` (random jitter), never faster
  than every 5 s, and at most every 60 s while the tab is hidden.
- Asking for a line marks it "watched" for ~10 min: the backend polls it at the top
  priority tier (~30 s), within a capped share of the OASA request budget.
- `404` `{"error":"unknown_line"}` for an unknown line. `503` `{"error":"warming_up"}`
  before the first poll of that line finished.
- `429` may come from Cloudflare rate limiting (per IP). The frontend backs off ≥ 10 s.

### `GET /v1/vehicles` (rev 3)

Every vehicle the backend knows now, from all lines, for a citywide map. Data comes from
the normal polling (watched lines ~30 s, busy ~60 s, others ~150 s); this endpoint does
**not** mark any line watched and causes no OASA request, so positions here can be up
to ~2.5 min staler than `/v1/lines/{id}` for lines nobody watches.

```json
{
  "updated_at": 1791100000,
  "next_update_at": 1791100030,
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "line": "040",
      "id": "52134",
      "lat": 37.9755, "lon": 23.7348,
      "bearing": 180,
      "position_at": 1791099988,
      "variant": "2045",
      "delay_s": 140,
      "speed": 6.4,
      "path": [[37.9755, 23.7348], [37.9781, 23.7356]],
      "path_beyond": [[37.9781, 23.7356], [37.98466, 23.73771]],
      "path_stops": [297, 1049],
      "path_speeds": [6.2, 3.1, 4.8, null]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Same field meanings as `/v1/lines/{id}`; `line` is the line id. Coordinates are rounded
  to 5 decimals. No `route_code`, `trip_id`, `trip_label`, `next_stop_id`: fetch
  `/v1/lines/{line}` when the user selects a vehicle.
- Vehicles with a GPS fix older than 5 min are left out. A vehicle seen on two lines
  appears once (newest fix). Sorted by `line`, then `id`. `vehicles` may be `[]`.
- One snapshot for everyone, built at most every 30 s (`updated_at` = build time,
  `next_update_at` = earliest next build). Refetch at `next_update_at + 1..3 s`.
- Headers: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=<seconds until next_update_at, min 5, max 30>`
  (the 5 s floor can keep a copy up to 5 s past `next_update_at`). `ETag`;
  `If-None-Match` gives `304`. In a browser, let the HTTP cache revalidate (plain
  `fetch`); do not set `If-None-Match` from JS: it is not a CORS-safelisted header and
  there is no `OPTIONS` preflight support. gzip when asked (~50 KB for 1500 vehicles).

### `GET /v1/vehicles/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}` (rev 5)

The `/v1/vehicles` snapshot cut into map tiles, so a client loads only what its map view shows.
Tiles are XYZ (Web Mercator, "slippy map") tiles, the scheme of OSM/MapLibre raster tiles. Each
tile is one fixed URL shared by all clients, so Cloudflare caches it like `/v1/vehicles`.
Example: `/v1/vehicles/tiles/13/4636/3160` (around Syntagma).

| `z` | tile size (Athens) | content | use at MapLibre zoom |
|---|---|---|---|
| `9` | ~62 km | vehicles without `path`, `path_beyond`, `path_stops`, `path_speeds` (the keys are absent) | < 13 |
| `13` | ~3.9 km | the same vehicle entries as `/v1/vehicles` | ≥ 13 |

```json
{
  "updated_at": 1791187860,
  "next_update_at": 1791187890,
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "line": "040", "id": "44537",
      "lat": 37.95614, "lon": 23.71609,
      "bearing": 52, "position_at": 1791187838,
      "variant": "5512", "delay_s": -35, "speed": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

- Body: the shape of `/v1/vehicles` (same fields, order and rules), with only the vehicles whose
  `lat`/`lon` is in that tile. A vehicle is in exactly one tile per zoom; its paths may run on
  into other tiles. `z` 13 entries are byte-identical to `/v1/vehicles`; `z` 9 entries have
  `line, id, lat, lon, bearing, position_at, variant, delay_s, speed` only.
- Same snapshot as `/v1/vehicles`: one build, at most every 30 s, gives `/v1/vehicles` and all
  tiles the same `updated_at` and `next_update_at`. No OASA request, no line marked watched.
- Tiles exist only for the box lat 37.5..38.5, lon 22.9..24.5: `z` 9 x 288..290, y 196..198;
  `z` 13 x 4617..4653, y 3145..3174. A tile in the box with no vehicle → `200` with
  `"vehicles":[]`. A vehicle is in a tile only when its `z` 13 tile is one of these (then its `z` 9
tile is too); one farther out is in no tile (none seen so far).
- Tile of a point (the usual slippy-map formula, `n = 2^z`):
  `x = floor((lon + 180) / 360 × n)`,
  `y = floor((1 − asinh(tan(lat × π/180)) / π) / 2 × n)`.
- `404` `{"error":"not_found"}` (`max-age=60`) for any other `z`, `x`/`y` outside the box, numbers
  not in plain decimal (`04636`, `+4636`), percent-encoded digits, or a trailing `/`. `400`
  `{"error":"query_not_allowed"}` (`no-store`) for any query string, even a bare `?`: each
  variant would be another Cloudflare cache entry. Never add cache busters.
- Headers as `/v1/vehicles`: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=<seconds until next_update_at,
  min 5, max 30>`, `ETag`, `If-None-Match` → `304`, gzip when asked, `Vary: Accept-Encoding`.
  Let the browser HTTP cache handle them (plain `fetch`); a tile asked again within its max-age
  then costs no request.

Client rules:

1. Tile set: take the map bounds, pad by 300 m (≈ 30 s of driving, so a vehicle that will drive
   into view is loaded), clamp to the box, choose `z` = 13 at MapLibre zoom ≥ 13 else 9, and take
   every tile from the north-west corner's tile to the south-east corner's tile.
2. On `moveend` (fires once the user stops panning or zooming): recompute the set, fetch tiles
   not loaded, drop vehicles of tiles that left the set. When `z` changes, replace the whole set.
3. Refresh all tiles of the set at `max(min(next_update_at) + 1..3 s, last refresh + 5 s)` (a
   cached copy can carry a `next_update_at` up to 5 s in the past), and at most every 60 s
   while the tab is hidden.
4. Merge all tiles by vehicle `id`: newer `position_at` wins, on a tie the response with the
   newer `updated_at`. Caches can mix two builds for a few seconds, so a vehicle that just
   crossed a tile edge can be in two tiles, or in none until the next refresh.
5. Fetch `/v1/lines/{line}` for `route_code`, `trip_id`, `trip_label`, `next_stop_id` when the
   user selects a vehicle, as with `/v1/vehicles`.
6. Cloudflare rate-limits per IP (`429`, back off ≥ 10 s). A desktop view at MapLibre 13 is ~15
   tiles; do not refetch tiles that are still fresh.

### `GET /v1/stops/{stop_id}` (rev 8)

The buses on their way to one stop and about when they get there (a stop board), from the
line polls the backend already makes: no OASA request of its own. The lines with a live bus
in `arrivals` are marked watched, as a line request does (polled about every 30 s for 10 min);
the others keep their usual rate. `stop_id` is the GTFS `stop_id`, as in
`static/v1/lines/{line_id}.json` → `stops`.

```json
{
  "stop": {"id": "61000", "name": "ΑΚΑΔΗΜΙΑ", "lat": 37.9799, "lon": 23.7333},
  "lines": ["022", "025", "026", "608"],
  "arrivals": [
    {
      "line": "608", "headsign": "ΝΕΚΡ. ΖΩΓΡΑΦΟΥ - ΑΚΑΔΗΜΙΑ - ΓΑΛΑΤΣΙ", "variant": "5346",
      "vehicle": "61191", "eta_s": 25, "at": 1793019999, "delay_s": -177,
      "position_at": 1793019859, "source": "live", "trip_id": "960_day_1_1625_1443",
      "scheduled": 1793020176, "stops_away": 1, "distance_m": 444
    },
    {
      "line": "026", "headsign": "ΒΟΤΑΝΙΚΟΣ", "variant": "5420",
      "vehicle": "", "eta_s": 526, "at": 1793020500, "delay_s": 0,
      "position_at": 0, "source": "schedule", "trip_id": "1032_day_1_2402_1540",
      "scheduled": 1793020500, "stops_away": null, "distance_m": null
    }
  ],
  "updated_at": 1793019974
}
```

- `lines`: every line with a trip that calls here, sorted (lines with no bus coming too).
  `updated_at`: when the answer was computed.
- `source: "live"`: a bus of those lines with a fix from the last 5 min whose route passes the
  stop ahead of it: its next pass (the first one on a loop), never a stop where its trip ends.
  A bus seen on two lines counts on the line of its newest fix only. Matched buses are placed
  by their trip; unmatched ones on the shape of their `variant` with that variant's stops, when
  the pass is clear (as for `speed`), else left out.
- `at`: `position_at` plus the time to drive the `distance_m` metres along the shape: per 200 m
  the typical speed of the last 14 days at that day type and hour (as `path_speeds`), where
  there is none the timetable's running time (matched) or 3.5 m/s (unmatched); waits at stops
  and lights are included. A matched bus waiting at its first stop leaves at its scheduled
  departure, or now when that is past. An unmatched bus standing at its first stop has no
  time and is left out. A bus not past the stop by its last fix is never overdue: late, it is
  due now (`at` = now). `eta_s` = `at` − now.
- `delay_s`: the matched bus's delay (positive = late); `0` when unmatched. `trip_id` and
  `scheduled` (the trip's timetable time at the stop) are `null` when unmatched.
  `stops_away`: `1` when the stop is the bus's next one.
- `source: "schedule"`: a trip of those lines that has not left its first stop yet, passes the
  stop within 60 min and has no matched bus; `at` = `scheduled`, `vehicle` `""`, `delay_s` and
  `position_at` `0`, `stops_away` and `distance_m` `null`. None while the static GTFS is expired
  (`gtfs_expires` in `/v1/status` is past): buses still match it, but its times may not be
  OASA's any more. A client that shows only buses filters on `source`.
- Up to 60 min ahead, sorted by `at`, at most 3 rows per `line` and `variant`. `arrivals` may
  be `[]`.
- Headers: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=15`. Refetch every 15-30 s while shown.
- `404` `{"error":"unknown_stop"}` (`max-age=60`) for an id not in the current GTFS. `503`
  `{"error":"warming_up"}` before the static GTFS is loaded.

### `GET /v1/status`

```json
{ "ok": true, "gtfs_version": "2026-10-06", "gtfs_expires": "2027-01-06",
  "updated_at": 1791100000, "lines_active": 312, "budget_rps": 4 }
```

`Cache-Control: public, max-age=10`. The frontend shows a banner if `ok` is false or
`gtfs_expires` is in the past.

### GTFS-Realtime feeds (whole network, for journey planners)

- `GET /v1/gtfs-rt/vehicle_positions.pb`
- `GET /v1/gtfs-rt/trip_updates.pb`
- `.json` variants of both, for debugging.

`Cache-Control: public, max-age=15`. The frontend does not use these.

## Static data (`.../athens-transit-rt/static/v1/`)

Published by GitHub Actions in the backend repo when OASA publishes a new GTFS.

### `lines.json`

```json
{
  "gtfs_version": "2026-10-06",
  "lines": [
    { "id": "040", "name": "ΠΕΙΡΑΙΑΣ - ΣΥΝΤΑΓΜΑ", "name_en": "PIRAEUS - SYNTAGMA",
      "color": "#1a73e8", "text_color": "#ffffff", "kind": "bus" }
  ]
}
```

`kind` is `bus` or `trolley`.

### `lines/{line_id}.json`

```json
{
  "id": "040",
  "variants": {
    "2045": {
      "headsign": "ΣΥΝΤΑΓΜΑ",
      "direction": 0,
      "shape": [[37.9420, 23.6466], [37.9431, 23.6480]],
      "stops": ["400012", "400013"]
    }
  },
  "stops": {
    "400012": { "name": "ΠΛ. ΚΑΡΑΪΣΚΑΚΗ", "lat": 37.9420, "lon": 23.6466 }
  }
}
```

`shape` is `[lat, lon]` pairs, rounded to 5 decimals. `variants[*].stops` is ordered.

## Unified API `/v2` (rev 8)

Implemented 2026-10-29 (branch `feat/v2-unified`; live once deployed). One model, Line / Stop /
Vehicle / Arrival / Run, for every mode. `/v1` above is unchanged. Terms:
[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md). Choices the draft left open and the places where the code differs
from the draft are in [DECISIONS-phase2.md](DECISIONS-phase2.md); the ones a client sees:

- **proastiakos is never `warming_up`** and `/v2/lines/{id}` never answers `line: null` for a
  suburban Line: corridors, stations and paths are embedded in the backend (decision 20).
- **proastiakos Stop ids** are the station ids of the embedded corridor table; the other
  railway.gov.gr ids of a station (Αεροδρόμιο `…cec7`, Άγιος Γεώργιος `…cfeb`) are permanent
  aliases (21).
- **Suburban Arrivals** are only runs of the three corridors (CHALKIDA, KIATO, PIRAIR), by the
  board's own corridor field (22). A board delay is `live` only for a run under way; a run not
  started is `timetable` (23). A train on the stream with no delay keeps `timetable` but names its
  `vehicle` (24). ose.mpass is not used by `/v2`: with no board, the Source is `down` (25).
- **Suburban stale**: board over 30 min old and its refresh failing, or the open stream silent
  for 2 min (26).
- **Suburban Vehicles** far (> 300 m) from their corridor keep their GPS position with
  `motion: null` (27). Direction 0 is the corridor file order (PIRAIR-0 is Αεροδρόμιο →
  Πειραιάς, CHALKIDA-0 Χαλκίδα → Αθήνα) (28). `/v2/runs/proastiakos:…` does not open the stream
  and answers only for today (29).
- **An unmatched bus on its way is still an Arrival** (`run`, `scheduled_at`, `delay_s` null),
  as `/v1/stops/{id}` lists it (2). A Run's last stop is not an Arrival (15).
- **`status: delayed`** from 5 minutes of delay in every mode (3). oasa Stop `name_en` and stasy
  Line/Stop `name_en` are `null`: the sources have no English names (5, 13, 14).
- `/v2/vehicles/rail` is metro and tram only, cached 15 s. Suburban trains are in
  `/v2/vehicles/suburban`, cached 5 s while trains are in it, else 15 s (review #9, item 11).

### 1. Goal and rules

- One model, **Line / Stop / Vehicle / Arrival**, for bus, trolley, metro (M1-M3), tram (T6, T7)
  and suburban (Proastiakos). The app and the web render it with one stop card, one line card and
  one vehicle marker for every mode.
- **Additive only.** Every rev 1-7 endpoint and field stays as it is (app v0.2.0 is out). The new
  model lives under a new path prefix, `/v2/` (Harold, 2026-10-29). `/v1` is not deprecated.
- **The backend owns the unification.** Each Source has one adapter. An adapter turns upstream
  data into the model below. A Source change (new URL, new format, a GTFS instead of a JSON
  board) changes only its adapter; responses keep their shape and their ids.
- **Missing data is labelled, never hidden.** Every optional field is present with `null` when
  not known (keys never disappear, except where noted for tile zoom 9). Clients render the same
  card and say "χωρίς ζωντανά δεδομένα" / "κατά το πρόγραμμα" from `source` and `position.kind`.

### 2. Sources and adapters

| Source id | Upstream | Modes | Adapter (today's code it wraps) | Live signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `oasa` | OASA static GTFS + telematics API | bus, trolley | `internal/gtfs`, `internal/telematics`, `internal/match`, `internal/server/stops.go` | GPS every 30-150 s; delay from the matcher |
| `stasy` | STASY static GTFS (data.gov.gr CKAN) + OSM track geometry | metro, tram | `internal/rail/stasy*.go` | none: timetable only |
| `proastiakos` | railway.gov.gr stations, schedule boards, train-stream (SSE); ose.mpass fallback | suburban | `internal/rail/proastiakos.go`, `trainstream.go` | GPS + delay while the stream is open |

New per adapter (phase 2): a stable id scheme (§3), Line names and colours, geometry, and an
alias table for ids that the upstream renames.

Geometry is in the backend (`internal/railgeo`, embedded). Until phases 3-4 the clients still bundle their copies: `athens-transit-map/public/metro.json`
(OSM tracks, built by `scripts/metro*.ts`) and `athens-transit-app/assets/suburban.json`
(corridor paths). The backend serves the same geometry as Pattern `shape`; clients stop bundling
it in phases 3-4.

### 3. Identity

All ids are opaque strings `<namespace>:<native>`, URL-safe after percent-encoding. Clients store
and compare them; they never parse them.

| Entity | `oasa` | `stasy` | `proastiakos` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Line | `oasa:040`, `oasa:Α1` (telematics LineID) | `stasy:M1`, `stasy:T6` (route_short_name) | `proastiakos:PIRAIR` (corridor) |
| Stop | `oasa:400012` (GTFS stop_id = OASA stop code) | `stasy:<folded-name>-<metro\|tram>`, e.g. `stasy:συνταγμα-metro` | `proastiakos:<primary station id>` |
| Vehicle | `oasa:52134` (vehicle no.) | `stasy:run:<trip_id>:<date>` (the Run itself) | `proastiakos:<train no.>` |
| Run | `oasa:run:<trip_id>:<date>` | `stasy:run:<trip_id>:<date>` | `proastiakos:run:<train no.>:<date>` |

- **Namespace = the numbering authority, not the fetch path.** If railway.gov.gr is replaced by
  a Hellenic Train GTFS, the adapter maps the new native ids to the old `proastiakos:` ids.
- **STASY stops are keyed by folded name + mode, not by `stop_id`.** STASY lists one `stop_id`
  per platform and may renumber them in a new feed; a name is what the passenger saves. All
  platforms with one folded name and one mode become one Stop.
- **Aliases.** Each adapter keeps a small table `old id → current id` (renamed stop, Αεροδρόμιο's
  second station id). A request with an alias id answers with the current object; its `id`
  field is the current id, so clients can rewrite stored Favourites. **Aliases are permanent**
  (never removed), and a published Line or Stop id is **never reused** for another Line or Stop,
  so a saved Alert always resolves or fails with `404`, never to the wrong place.
- Run ids (`oasa:run:<trip_id>:<date>`, `stasy:run:<trip_id>:<date>`,
  `proastiakos:run:<train no.>:<date>`; on an expired OASA GTFS a run of OASA's daily schedule is
  `oasa:run:<trip_id>@<HHMM>:<date>`, its departure and the GTFS trip that gives its stop times) and `stasy:run:*` Vehicle ids live only for their service
  day. Clients never store Vehicle or Run ids.
- `/v1` ids map 1:1: `/v1` line `040` = `oasa:040`; `/v1` stop `400012` = `oasa:400012`.

### 4. Objects

#### Line

```json
{
  "id": "proastiakos:PIRAIR",
  "mode": "suburban",
  "label": null,
  "name": "Πειραιάς – Αεροδρόμιο",
  "name_en": "Piraeus – Airport",
  "color": "#2e7d32",
  "text_color": "#ffffff",
  "source": "proastiakos"
}
```

- `mode`: `bus` | `trolley` | `metro` | `tram` | `suburban`. A new mode is an additive change;
  clients show an unknown mode with a generic icon.
- `label`: short public code or `null`. Badge rule: `label` present → coloured badge with the
  label; `null` → mode icon on `color` with `name` (truncated).
- `name`: always present. `name_en`: `null` when the Source has none.
- `color`, `text_color`: always present; the adapter supplies a default per mode when the Source
  has none.

#### Stop

```json
{
  "id": "stasy:συνταγμα-metro",
  "name": "Σύνταγμα",
  "name_en": "Syntagma",
  "lat": 37.97527, "lon": 23.73552,
  "modes": ["metro"],
  "lines": ["stasy:M2", "stasy:M3"],
  "source": "stasy"
}
```

- `lat`/`lon`: one point (mean of the platforms for merged STASY stops). 5 decimals.
- `modes`: the modes of `lines`, sorted; a bus stop can be `["bus","trolley"]`.
- `lines`: Line ids that call here, sorted by mode then label/name.
- `name_en`: `null` when unknown (OASA has it for most stops; STASY and railway.gov.gr do).

#### Vehicle

```json
{
  "id": "stasy:run:1012345:2026-10-29",
  "line": "stasy:M2",
  "run": "stasy:run:1012345:2026-10-29",
  "mode": "metro",
  "headsign": "Ελληνικό",
  "label": null,
  "position": {"kind": "estimate", "lat": 37.9722, "lon": 23.7325, "bearing": 205, "at": 1793205600},
  "delay_s": null,
  "next_stop": "stasy:ακροπολη-metro",
  "direction": 0,
  "motion": {
    "path": [[37.9722, 23.7325], [37.96882, 23.72963]],
    "path_beyond": [[37.96882, 23.72963], [37.96421, 23.72651]],
    "path_stops": [450, 1010],
    "speed": null,
    "path_speeds": null,
    "knots": [[0, 1793205600], [450, 1793205660], [450, 1793205690], [1010, 1793205760]]
  },
  "source": "stasy"
}
```

- `label`: what the passenger reads on the vehicle: bus fleet no. (`52134`), suburban train no.
  (`1226`); `null` for metro/tram (no physical train is known).
- `position.kind`: `gps` | `estimate`. `position.at`: the GPS fix time, or for an estimate the
  build time of the snapshot. `bearing` may be `null`.
- `delay_s`: `null` when there is no live signal (always for metro/tram).
- `run`: Run id, `null` when the Vehicle is not matched to a Run.
- `next_stop`: Stop id, `null` when unmatched.
- `direction` (rev 12): the `direction` (0/1) of the Pattern the Vehicle runs, so a client can
  put it on one of the Line's two tracks without a `/v2/runs` call. Metro and tram: always set.
  Bus and trolley: the matched trip's direction, else the direction of the trip the bus was
  placed on, else `null`. Suburban: the direction of its Run when it has one, else of where it
  is placed on its corridor, else `null`.
  Present in tiles at zoom 9 too. Older responses lack the key: treat a missing key as `null`.
- `motion`: how the client moves the marker between snapshots. `null` when there is nothing to
  move along (standing with no Run, no geometry).
  - `path`, `path_beyond`, `path_stops`, `speed`, `path_speeds`: the rev 3-7 meanings, unchanged
    for buses (1.5 km caps included); for suburban they run along the rail geometry of §2.
  - For **estimates** (metro/tram) the 1.5 km caps do not apply: `path` runs to the next Stop
    and `path_beyond` to the third Stop ahead, whatever the distance.
  - `knots` (new, estimates only; `null` for GPS vehicles): `[metres along path + path_beyond,
    unix time]` pairs. The first knot is `[0, position.at]`. Each Stop ahead gives two knots,
    its arrival and its departure, with the same metres (one knot when the two times are equal).
    Metres never decrease; times strictly increase. The last knot is at the end of
    `path_beyond` (or of `path`).
  - **Client rule, one for all modes:** if `knots` is present, place the marker by time: before
    the first knot at metre 0, between two knots linearly in metres (equal metres = dwell at the
    Stop), after the last knot at its metres until the next snapshot. Otherwise use the rev 6
    speed rule (`path_speeds`, then `speed`, then 1.5 m/s) and stop at the end of the points.
    This is the "trains glide along the track" behaviour. Test cases for a client's mover:
    [`fixtures/v2/motion-cases.json`](fixtures/v2/motion-cases.json) (time → metres, checked
    against a reference in `internal/model/motion_test.go`); the backend checks these rules on
    every train of its test feed through a service day.
- `source`: the Source id.

#### Arrival

```json
{
  "line": "proastiakos:PIRAIR",
  "stop": "proastiakos:6928c3c150ab5bc72b39cee5",
  "headsign": "Αεροδρόμιο",
  "at": 1793205900,
  "scheduled_at": 1793205780,
  "delay_s": 120,
  "source": "live",
  "run": "proastiakos:run:1226:2026-10-29",
  "vehicle": "proastiakos:1226",
  "vehicle_label": "1226",
  "platform": "2",
  "status": "running"
}
```

- `at`: the expected time (leaving time for rail; see the Glossary). Always present.
- `scheduled_at`: the timetable time; `null` when the Source has no timetable for it (an OASA bus
  matched to no trip is not listed at all, as in rev 7).
- `delay_s`: the **observed** delay of the Vehicle (or the Source's reported delay for the
  Run), else `null`. Normally `at = scheduled_at + delay_s`, but `at` is clamped to now (a bus
  already due), so clients must not compute one from the other.
- `source`: `live` | `timetable`. `live` only when GPS or a reported delay set `at`. Suburban
  precedence: stream delay (stream open) → board delay (board ≤ 10 min old) → timetable; the
  first two give `live`.
- `run`: Run id, so the card can open the Run even before it starts; `null` only for an OASA
  bus matched to no trip (not listed today).
- `vehicle`, `vehicle_label`: `null` when no Vehicle is on the Run yet or none is known. Metro/tram:
  `vehicle` is set only while the Run is under way; `vehicle_label` is always `null`.
- `platform`: `null` unless the Source gives one (only railway.gov.gr today).
- `status`: `scheduled` | `running` | `delayed`. Cancelled Runs are left out, as today.

#### Source state (in every list response)

```json
"sources": [
  {"id": "oasa", "state": "ok", "updated_at": 1793205590},
  {"id": "stasy", "state": "indicative", "updated_at": 1793205000},
  {"id": "proastiakos", "state": "warming_up", "updated_at": null}
]
```

`state`: `ok` | `warming_up` | `stale` (last good data served) | `indicative` (expired
timetable, the same weekday stands in) | `down` (no data at all). Freshness is per Source,
because their signals differ:

| Source | `stale` when | `indicative` when | `down` when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `oasa` | no successful line poll for 5 min (as `/v1/status` `ok:false`) | static GTFS expired and no OASA daily schedule of today cached for the response's lines (any line for the lists) | no data since start |
| `stasy` | the daily check failed and the loaded timetable is from an earlier day | timetable expired (today's `indicative:true`) | no timetable loaded |
| `proastiakos` | stream open but no event for 2 min, or board older than 30 min | never | no board and no ose.mpass answer |

`updated_at`: the last good data of that Source (GPS fix, stream event, board fetch, timetable
load). Only the
Sources that the response draws on are listed. Clients show a one-line note per non-`ok` Source;
they never drop the card.

### 5. Endpoints (`/v2`)

All: UTF-8 JSON, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, gzip, times in Unix seconds, `ETag` +
`If-None-Match` → `304` where cached ≥ 60 s. **No query strings** on the cached map endpoints
(tiles), as in rev 5. Errors keep the rev 7 shape `{"error": "<code>"}`.

| Endpoint | Body | Cache (`max-age`) | Side effect upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /v2/lines` | `{lines: [Line], sources}` all modes | 3600 | none |
| `GET /v2/lines/{id}` | `{line: Line, patterns: [Pattern], stops: {id: Stop}, sources}` | 3600 | none |
| `GET /v2/lines/{id}/vehicles` | `{line, updated_at, next_update_at, vehicles: [Vehicle], sources}` | until `next_update_at`, 5-300 | `oasa`: marks the line watched (as `/v1/lines/{id}`); `proastiakos`: opens the stream |
| `GET /v2/stops` | `{stops: [StopIndexEntry], sources}` every Stop of every mode | 3600 | none |
| `GET /v2/stops/{id}` | `{stop: Stop, lines: [Line], arrivals: [Arrival], updated_at, sources}` | 15 | `oasa`: raises its lines' priority; `proastiakos`: opens the stream |
| `GET /v2/vehicles` | `{updated_at, next_update_at, vehicles: [Vehicle], sources}` bus + trolley | until `next_update_at`, 5-30 | none |
| `GET /v2/vehicles/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}` | as `/v2/vehicles`, tile-cut as rev 5 | as above | none |
| `GET /v2/vehicles/rail` | as `/v2/vehicles`, metro + tram (~60 vehicles, one body) | until `next_update_at`, 5-30 | none |
| `GET /v2/vehicles/suburban` | as `/v2/vehicles`, suburban trains (~10, one body) | until `next_update_at`, 5-30 | `proastiakos`: opens the stream |
| `GET /v2/runs/{id}` | `{run: Run, sources}` | 15 | none |

// Run (also before it starts: vehicle null, every stop passed:false)
{"id": "stasy:run:1012345:2026-10-29", "line": "stasy:M2", "headsign": "Ελληνικό",
 "pattern": "stasy:M2-0", "vehicle": "stasy:run:1012345:2026-10-29", "vehicle_label": null,
 "status": "running",
 "stops": [{"stop": "stasy:ακροπολη-metro", "scheduled_at": 1793205660, "at": 1793205660,
            "delay_s": null, "source": "timetable", "platform": null, "passed": false}]}
```

Rules:

- `/v2/stops/{id}` arrivals: soonest first, at most 2 h ahead, at most 4 per Line + headsign, at
  most 30 in all. Bus arrivals: those of rev 7 (`/v1/stops/{id}`, `live`), plus the timetable
  Arrivals of Runs no matched bus has started yet (`timetable`, `vehicle: null`; Harold,
  2026-10-29). Metro/tram: the STASY
  timetable. Suburban: the board, with the stream's delay when it is open.
- `/v2/vehicles` and tiles carry bus and trolley only, like rev 3/5: map traffic must not keep
  the railway.gov.gr stream open. Metro and tram vehicles come from `/v2/vehicles/rail`, which
  opens nothing upstream. Suburban vehicles come from `/v2/vehicles/suburban`, which a client
  loads only while its suburban layer is on and a corridor is in view; that request is the
  explicit suburban demand. Clients merge all three into one vehicles layer (one marker
  component). Tile zoom 9 entries drop `motion`
  (key absent), as rev 5 drops the path keys.
- Metro/tram vehicles are placed at build time (every 30 s); their `knots` keep them moving.
- Pattern `direction` (rev 12): every Line has two directions, 0 and 1, never more. OASA and
  suburban: the GTFS / corridor direction. Metro/tram: the most common Pattern is 0; each other
  Pattern is 0 or 1 by the order of two Stops it shares with a Pattern already decided, so a
  branch that shares one Stop with the main Pattern (M3 airport) still gets the right one. M3:
  every Pattern towards ΕΛ. ΒΕΝΙΖΕΛΟΣ or Δ. ΠΛΑΚΕΝΤΙΑΣ is 1, every one towards ΔΗΜΟΤΙΚΟ ΘΕΑΤΡΟ
  is 0 (before rev 12 the airport Patterns could get 0 in both directions).
- `/v2/runs/{id}` replaces `/v1/rail/stasy/trips/{id}` and `/v1/rail/suburban/trains/{no}` for
  the line card. It answers for any Run of the service day, started or not (`vehicle: null`
  before it starts). OASA: the matched trip's stops, timetable time plus observed delay.
  `404 {"error":"unknown_run"}` outside the service day.
- Unknown ids: `404` `unknown_line` / `unknown_stop` / `unknown_run`. A Source still loading:
  `200` with the Source `warming_up` in `sources`, empty lists, and `null` for a single object
  that Source should fill (e.g. `line: null` in `/v2/lines/{id}` for a suburban Line before the
  corridor table loads, never `404` then). Never `503`, so one slow Source does not blank a card
  that also shows other Sources.
- **Incomplete responses are cached at most 5 s** (`max-age=5`, no `ETag`): any response with a
  Source `warming_up` or `down`. The long `max-age` above applies only to complete responses, so a
  Source that recovers shows within seconds, not after an hour. `stale` and `indicative` are
  complete: they are steady states (an expired timetable can stand in for weeks), and the
  `sources` block already says so.
- **`/v2/stops` has a strong `ETag`.** Its bytes are built once and kept while the stops and the
  Source states stay the same; an `ok` Source's `updated_at` does not change them, so the body
  carries the `updated_at` of its build. Clients keep the index and send `If-None-Match`; a `304`
  costs no body.

### 6. Mode × field availability

`✓` from the Source, `≈` estimate, `—` missing (`null`), `↻` only while the suburban stream is open.

| Field | bus / trolley (`oasa`) | metro / tram (`stasy`) | suburban (`proastiakos`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Line `label` | ✓ | ✓ | — (badge falls back) |
| Line `color` | ✓ (GTFS / default) | ✓ GTFS `route_color` | adapter table |
| Stop `name_en` | ✓ most | ✓ | ✓ |
| Pattern `shape` | ✓ GTFS | ✓ OSM track | ✓ corridor path |
| Vehicle `position.kind` | `gps` | `estimate` | `gps` ↻ |
| Vehicle `label` | ✓ fleet no. | — | ✓ train no. |
| Vehicle `delay_s` | ✓ when matched | — | ✓ ↻ |
| Vehicle `motion.path*` | ✓ when matched | ≈ from timetable + track | ≈ snapped to track, ahead at `speed` |
| Vehicle `motion.speed` | ✓ | — | ✓ (`speed_kmh` / 3.6) |
| Vehicle `motion.path_speeds` | ✓ | — | — |
| Vehicle `motion.knots` | — | ≈ | — |
| Arrival `source` | `live`; `timetable` before a bus starts its Run | `timetable` | `live` ↻ or board ≤ 10 min, else `timetable` |
| Arrival `scheduled_at` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Arrival `delay_s` | ✓ | — | ✓ ↻ / board (≤ 10 min old) |
| Arrival `vehicle_label` | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Arrival `platform` | — | — | ✓ when the board has it |
| Run (`/v2/runs/{id}`) | ✓ when matched | ✓ | ✓ |

### 7. Which adapter fills what

- **`oasa`**: Line, Pattern, Stop from the OASA GTFS (today's static `lines.json` /
  `lines/{id}.json` data); Vehicle from the matcher's vehicles (today's `/v1/lines/{id}` fields
  renamed: `bearing`, `position_at` → `position`; `variant` → Pattern id; `trip_label` dropped
  (the card builds it); `path*` → `motion`); Arrival from `internal/server/stops.go`. On an
  expired GTFS the timetable Arrivals and their Runs come from OASA's daily schedule
  (`getDailySchedule`, cached and prefetched once a day; a request never asks OASA for it): the
  run's departure plus the stop's offset in the GTFS trip of that direction that starts nearest
  in time. A line not cached yet has no timetable Arrivals (live ones only).
- **`stasy`**: Line from `routes.txt` (+ default names "Γραμμή 1" … when the feed leaves them
  empty); Stop by folding `stops.txt` names per mode; Pattern from the distinct stop sequences of
  `trips.txt` + the OSM track cut between stops; Vehicle from `STASY.Vehicles` (`from`/`to`
  become `next_stop`, `path`, `knots`); Arrival from the departures index; `indicative` →
  Source state.
- **`proastiakos`**: Line from the corridor table (names and colours in the adapter, as
  `suburban.json` has them); Stop from `corridor-stations` (ids merged, aliases kept); Pattern
  from the corridor path and its ordered stations; Vehicle from the train-stream (snapped to the
  corridor path; `course` → `bearing`); Arrival from the board + stream delay; ose.mpass when the
  board fails.

### 8. Not in rev 8

- Cross-mode interchange grouping (Πειραιάς M1 + suburban + tram + buses as one place): not
  planned. Separate Stops; the Stop card lists nearby Stops of other modes (Harold, 2026-10-29).
- Rail vehicles inside the shared tiles: rejected (keeps the suburban stream open for bus-only
  map traffic, ~80 KB/s upstream; Codex review 2026-10-29).
- Server-side Alerts or push: Alerts stay client-side and poll `/v2/stops/{id}`.
- MCP tools keep their names; they may switch to the `/v2` model inside without a contract change.

## Fixtures

`docs/fixtures/` in the backend repo holds one example of every response above
(`line-040.json`, `vehicles.json`, `vehicles-tile-13-4636-3160.json`,
`vehicles-tile-9-289-197.json`, `stop-61000.json`, `status.json`, `lines.json`, `lines-040.json`). The frontend
develops against copies of these until the live API is up. `/v2` examples: `docs/fixtures/v2/`.
